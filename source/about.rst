PCIe stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, and it is a high-speed interface standard used for connecting various internal components in a computer system. PCIe is primarily used for connecting expansion cards (graphics cards, network cards, storage controllers) to the motherboard.

PCIe slots on a motherboard come in different sizes, referred to as “lanes” (we’ll get to those in just a bit). Common slot configurations include x1, x4, x8, and x16, which represent the number of data lanes available for communication. A higher number of lanes generally results in higher data transfer rates between the motherboard and the expansion card.
